# angularWRDcalc
This project is the repository for my Ionic 2 based WRD Calculator.  This is based on my Android native WRD Calculator application. This application specifically allows users to calculate the damage inflicted on a vehicle through either Armor Piercing (AP) or High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) rounds. It also calculates the chances of an aircraft with specific electronic counter-measure (ECM) statistics being hit by a surface-to-air missile (SAM). The user navigates between these three calculators through tabbed navigation schema.
